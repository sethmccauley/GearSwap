# GearSwap
Collection of lua files for GearSwap.

# determine_haste_group:
  Built to interact with 3 toggles within gearswap. Detects buffs you currently have and based on your toggles, adds up your total amount of haste and modifies your melee groups.
  
# langly_include:
  Houses some functions I've repeatedly used or modified for my own luas.
  
# job_handle_equipping_gear:
  New logic to prevent any 'lockables' you don't want removed by gearswap should they be either 'enchanted items' you intend to use or augmented items like a Mecisto. Cape you always want to have on during CP. Will allow the items with cooldown timers you've used to be swapped to your appropriate gear within gearswap.
